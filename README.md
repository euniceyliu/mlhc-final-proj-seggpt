## Project Overview

This research project focuses on enhancing the interpretability of disease predictions derived from satellite imagery by employing the [SegGPT model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.03284). The SegGPT is a generalist image segmentation model renowned for its capability to manage diverse elements found in satellite imagery such as buildings, vegetation, and water bodies. The model uses an innovative coloring method during training, where segmentation is based on random color mappings linked to contextual information, enabling dynamic handling of various segmentation challenges without specific model retraining. By utilizing in-context learning along with one- and two-shot learning frameworks, SegGPT minimizes the need for extensive annotated datasets. This approach enables the effective identification of environmental factors critical to disease transmission dynamics, crucial for improving satellite-based disease prediction. Our goal is to provide actionable insights for public health interventions, particularly in under-resourced regions.
